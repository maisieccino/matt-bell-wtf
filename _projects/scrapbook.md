Scrapbook is an offline bookmark store. Think of it like your browser's
bookmarks, except you can use it with all of your browsers. Or think of it like
Pocket, except your data isn't being sent to the cloud.

Currently I've build a proof of concept Electron desktop app, which lets you
create new bookmarks and open them in your browser of choice. It also runs a
local server so that browsers on your computer can interact with it.

I've also built a very simple Chrome extension for saving sites to your bookmark
store.
