Coffee School is a project to provide an introduction to JavaScript and give
some exposure to game development in an interactive environment where the
student can see the direct result of their code without having to install or run
anything locally on their machine.

Once students are introduced to JavaScript in general, Coffee School gets
students to produce a game similar to "Flappy Bird" through a series of lessons
using a JavaScript framework called Craftyjs while trying to inform about
programming and game development concepts and practices where relevant. It is
aimed at GCSE students aged 14-17.

For the lessons the students will just need a web browser.
